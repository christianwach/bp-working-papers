BuddyPress Working Papers creates WordPress Sites with embedded BuddyPress Groups for peer reviewing Working Papers.



== Description ==

The BuddyPress Working Papers plugin creates a relationship between BuddyPress Groups and WordPress Sites for the purpose of peer reviewing Working Papers. The plugin is specifically designed to work with [CommentPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/commentpress-core/) "documents" (which are themselves complete sub-sites) so that there can be effective peer review.

**Please note:** This plugin is multisite only. It works best with [Commons in a Box](https://wordpress.org/plugins/commons-in-a-box/)
